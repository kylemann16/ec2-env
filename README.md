### EC2 Generation in Terraform

Make it quick to start up an instance with correct settings that is on the platform I currently need to debug in.

TODO
 - Add scripts that connect you to your instance
    - For linux/alpine/osx allow ssh
    - for windows find a way to start up vm connected to this? more reserach needed.
 - Allow users (me) to replace userdata script or concat their own onto the stock one
